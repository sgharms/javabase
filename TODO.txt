* Code is ugly

* Code smells

* Remove those lines that call "TODO/" as a parameter. Somehow I coded around
  them but never removed them. This is probably bad logic.

* Irony alert: I encouraged the java developers using the output to write
  tests, yet I have no tests. Bad.

* Try out running this as a Rubygem with the built-in bundling Dave provided.
